# Code Quiz
As a coding student, I want to be able to be able to study different terms and keywords in a simple, clean, and easy way. That is what this web application provides. It has a very simple and easy to navigate UI. The program includes the feature of setting scores based on how well you do during the quiz to give you more drive to do better each time you take the quiz. The web application uses localStorage to save those high scores so that when you close your browser and then come back at a later time to test your knowledge once again, you will be able to see all your previous high scores inside the "View Highscores" section
